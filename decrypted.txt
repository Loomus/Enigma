the fall of gondolin

tolkien began writing the story that would become "the fall of gondolin" in 1917 in an army barracks on the back of a sheet of military marching music. it is the first traceable story of his middle-earth legendarium that he wrote down on paper. while the first half of the story "appears to echo tolkien's creative development and slow acceptance of duty in the first year of the war," the second half echoes his personal experience of battle.

tolkien was constantly revising his first age stories; however, the narrative he wrote in 1917, published posthumously in the book of lost tales, remains the only full account of the fall of the city. the narrative in the silmarillion was the result of the editing by his son christopher using that story (minus some elements all too obviously evocative of world war i warfare) and compressed versions from the different versions of the annals and quentas as various sources. the later quenta silmarillion and the grey annals of beleriand, the main sources for much of the published silmarillion, both stop before the beginning of the tuor story.

a partial later version of "the fall of gondolin" was published in the unfinished tales under the title "of tuor and his coming to gondolin". originally titled "of tuor and the fall of gondolin," this narrative shows a great expansion of the earlier tale. christopher tolkien retitled the story before including it in unfinished tales, because it ends at the point of tuor's arrival in gondolin, and does not depict the actual fall.

there is also an unfinished poem, the lay of the fall of gondolin, of which a few verses are quoted in the lays of beleriand. in 130 verses tolkien reaches the point where dragons attack the city.
